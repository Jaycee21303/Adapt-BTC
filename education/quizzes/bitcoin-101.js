        { prompt: 'Why does Bitcoin use a fixed supply schedule?', options: ['To mirror fiat inflation', 'To enforce predictable scarcity', 'To match gold production', 'To allow central control'], answer: 1, explanation: 'A fixed supply schedule enforces transparent scarcity and removes discretionary inflation.' },
        { prompt: 'What role do full nodes play?', options: ['Create new bitcoins', 'Enforce consensus rules by validating blocks and transactions', 'Set mining difficulty', 'Control wallet interfaces'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Nodes validate data and reject invalid transactions or blocks regardless of miner behavior.' },
        { prompt: 'Why are UTXOs important?', options: ['They define spendable bitcoin and prevent double-spends', 'They store smart contracts', 'They track fiat prices', 'They sign blocks'], answer: 0, explanation: 'UTXOs represent individual spendable outputs and are consumed and created in each transaction.' },
        { prompt: 'What secures Bitcoin against Sybil attacks?', options: ['Proof-of-work and economic cost', 'Government regulation', 'Closed membership', 'Manual approvals'], answer: 0, explanation: 'Proof-of-work makes it expensive to outvote honest miners and prevents cheap identity creation.' },
        { prompt: 'Why is self-custody recommended?', options: ['It reduces fees', 'It eliminates exchange hacks and counterparty risk', 'It increases block rewards', 'It shortens confirmations'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Holding your own keys removes custodial failure modes.' },
        { prompt: 'What happens if a wallet reuses addresses?', options: ['Nothing changes', 'Privacy degrades and funds can be linked', 'Blocks confirm faster', 'Fees increase automatically'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Address reuse leaks information about balances and spending patterns.' },
        { prompt: 'How is block difficulty adjusted?', options: ['Every block', 'Every 2016 blocks based on hashrate changes', 'Once per year', 'Never changes'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Difficulty retargets every 2016 blocks to target ~10 minute intervals.' },
        { prompt: 'Why verify software signatures?', options: ['To speed up downloads', 'To ensure binaries are authentic and untampered', 'To reduce bandwidth', 'To unlock premium features'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Signature verification ensures you run trusted, unmodified node or wallet software.' },
        { prompt: 'What does RBF allow?', options: ['Speeding confirmations with a replacement transaction', 'Reversing mined blocks', 'Printing new coins', 'Reducing mempool size'], answer: 0, explanation: 'Replace-By-Fee lets you broadcast a higher-fee version of an unconfirmed transaction.' },
        { prompt: 'Why practice disaster recovery?', options: ['It lowers mining difficulty', 'It ensures seed backups and spending paths work under stress', 'It increases yield', 'It doubles rewards'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Recovery drills confirm that backups, policies, and team procedures function when needed.' }
