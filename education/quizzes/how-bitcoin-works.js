    questions: [
        { prompt: 'What triggers a difficulty adjustment?', options: ['Hashrate change over 2016 blocks', 'Price changes', 'Number of wallets', 'Node count'], answer: 0, explanation: 'Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks based on observed block intervals.' },
        { prompt: 'Why do miners include transactions?', options: ['They are required by law', 'Fees and block space markets incentivize them', 'To control addresses', 'To change consensus rules'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Fees reward miners for ordering transactions while following rules enforced by nodes.' },
        { prompt: 'How do nodes reach consensus?', options: ['Voting on forums', 'Following the longest valid chain with most accumulated proof-of-work', 'Central coordinators', 'Through mining pools only'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Nodes follow the valid chain with the most work that follows protocol rules.' },
        { prompt: 'What does mempool represent?', options: ['Confirmed blocks', 'Pending valid transactions not yet mined', 'Wallet balances', 'Miner income'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Mempool holds validated unconfirmed transactions waiting for miners.' },
        { prompt: 'Why are Merkle trees used?', options: ['To compress transaction data and prove inclusion efficiently', 'To store keys', 'To calculate price', 'To broadcast headers'], answer: 0, explanation: 'Merkle trees allow light clients to verify transactions with minimal data.' },
        { prompt: 'What protects against chain reorgs?', options: ['Finality after multiple confirmations', 'Paying higher fees', 'Using multisig', 'Setting low fees'], answer: 0, explanation: 'Waiting for confirmations reduces risk of reorgs reversing transactions.' },
        { prompt: 'What is a coinbase transaction?', options: ['A bank transfer', 'The first transaction in a block that pays the miner', 'A Lightning payment', 'A zero-fee spend'], answer: 1, explanation: 'The coinbase transaction creates the block subsidy and collects fees.' },
        { prompt: 'Why run your own node?', options: ['To mine blocks', 'To validate independently, preserve privacy, and reduce reliance on third parties', 'To earn interest', 'To lower taxes'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Your own node enforces rules for your wallet and protects privacy.' },
        { prompt: 'What is an orphaned block?', options: ['A block with no transactions', 'A block not part of the main chain due to a competing block at the same height', 'A block without fees', 'A block from a pruned node'], answer: 1, explanation: 'When two blocks are mined around the same time, one becomes stale and dropped from the longest chain.' },
        { prompt: 'Why do wallets estimate fees?', options: ['To guarantee free transactions', 'To target timely confirmation based on mempool conditions', 'To increase miner profits', 'To reduce address reuse'], answer: 1, explanation: 'Fee estimation aligns transaction priority with current blockspace demand.' }
