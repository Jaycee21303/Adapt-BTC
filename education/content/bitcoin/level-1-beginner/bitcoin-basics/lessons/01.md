## Big idea
Bitcoin emerged to provide a peer-to-peer cash system that removes gatekeepers and anchors monetary policy in code.

## Explanation
The 2008 whitepaper proposed a way to finalize payments without banks, using proof-of-work to secure a public ledger. Nodes verify and miners add blocks so no single party controls issuance.

## Real-world example
When exchanging value across borders, Bitcoin transactions settle globally without needing correspondent banks or country-specific rails.

## Key takeaways
- Bitcoin addresses trust to an open network
- Proof-of-work defends the chain
- Monetary policy is predictable and transparent
