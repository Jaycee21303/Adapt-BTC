## Big idea
Protecting keys is the core of self-custody; backups and device hygiene prevent loss and theft.

## Explanation
Seed phrases should be recorded offline, stored redundantly, and never typed into unknown devices. Hardware wallets keep private keys isolated while signing transactions.

## Real-world example
Using a hardware wallet with a passphrase adds a second factor. Even if one backup is lost, another secure copy keeps funds accessible.

## Key takeaways
- Back up the seed phrase offline
- Prefer hardware wallets for spending
- Test small transactions before moving large value
