## Big idea
Transactions reference previous outputs and create new ones, ensuring every satoshi is accounted for.

## Explanation
Wallets construct transactions by selecting UTXOs, defining recipients, and signing with private keys. Nodes check signatures and consensus rules before a miner includes the transaction in a block.

## Real-world example
Paying a merchant creates change back to your wallet. The network validates amounts and signatures without seeing your identity.

## Key takeaways
- UTXOs represent spendable coins
- Signatures prove ownership without revealing keys
- Miners add valid transactions to blocks
