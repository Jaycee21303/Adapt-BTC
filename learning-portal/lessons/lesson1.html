      <h1>What Is Bitcoin?</h1>
      <p>Bitcoin is the first widely adopted form of digital property—scarce, portable, and secured by an open network.</p>
      <h3>Digital property</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin exists as entries in a public ledger. Ownership is controlled by private keys rather than accounts at intermediaries.</p>
      <h3>Scarcity (21M)</h3>
      <p>The protocol caps supply at 21 million coins, released on a predictable schedule. This hard cap creates digital scarcity.</p>
      <h3>Decentralization</h3>
      <p>No single entity controls Bitcoin. Thousands of nodes validate rules, miners add blocks, and anyone can self-verify.</p>
      <h3>Why Bitcoin was created</h3>
      <p>Satoshi launched Bitcoin in 2009 as a response to fragile banking and to enable peer-to-peer money without trusted third parties.</p>
      <h3>Importance of sats</h3>
      <p>Each bitcoin splits into 100,000,000 satoshis (sats). Quoting values in sats makes small payments intuitive.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin vs fiat</h3>
      <p>Fiat currencies inflate as supply expands. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and transparent issuance make it resistant to debasement.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin vs gold</h3>
      <p>Gold is scarce but heavy to move and hard to audit. Bitcoin moves at internet speed and is auditable by anyone.</p>
      <h3>Global network</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin operates 24/7 with no borders. Anyone with internet access can send, receive, and validate transactions.</p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bitcoin is digital property with a fixed 21M supply.</li>
          <li>Decentralized validation keeps it neutral and censorship-resistant.</li>
          <li>Sats enable small, global payments.</li>
