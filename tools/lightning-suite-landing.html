  <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
  <p>
    Bitcoin adoption can be overwhelming, especially for beginners and small businesses.
    The Lightning Network adds even more complexity — channels, liquidity, invoices, routing,
    fees, node selection, and payment failures.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AdaptBTC Lightning Adoption Suite solves this with an integrated, zero-cost,
    browser-based tool that educates, analyzes, and guides users step-by-step.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <div class="who-grid">
    <div class="who-card">

      <h3>Will it hit our node?</h3>
      <p>Only if you point <code>safeFetch</code> to your node. The default build uses public data so workshops remain safe.</p>
