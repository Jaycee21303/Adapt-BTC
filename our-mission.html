  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
    Empowering individuals and businesses to understand, adopt,  
    and thrive with Bitcoin — confidently, responsibly, and independently.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- SECTION 1: Why We Exist -->
<section class="section container">
  <h2>Why AdaptBTC Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Millions of people are hearing about Bitcoin for the first time —  
    yet most still don’t understand what it truly is or how to use it safely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some learn through hype. Some learn too late.  
    Others never learn at all because no one explains it clearly.
  </p>

  <div class="card">
    <p>
      We believe Bitcoin is more than an investment.  
      It is a tool for financial independence, time protection,  
      and long-term economic resilience.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- SECTION 3: What We Believe -->
<section class="section container">
  <h2>Our Core Beliefs</h2>

  <div class="grid-3">
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Financial Literacy Matters</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone deserves to understand money — how it works,  
        why it loses value, and how Bitcoin changes the equation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Self-Custody Is Empowerment</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin gives people direct ownership over their savings  
        without relying on banks or corporations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Education Should Be Accessible</h3>
      <p>
        Bitcoin can feel overwhelming.  
        We break it down in clear language anyone can understand.
